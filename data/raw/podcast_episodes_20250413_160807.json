        "description": "At the heart of President Trump's tariffs is this idea that we should not be buying more from other countries than they are buying from us. Basically, he wants to get rid of the trade deficit. <br /><br />And in the wake of the tariff announcement we got a LOT of questions from listeners about what that means. Do trade deficits matter? Is it bad to have a trade deficit? Are we getting ripped off? <br /><br />Today on the show \u2013 we tackle those questions. <br /><br /><em>This episode of Planet Money was produced by Emma Peaslee and edited by Marianne McCune and Kenny Malone.

        "description": "What are tariffs good for?<br /><br />For years, mainstream economists have basically said: tariffs are not good. They are an import tax paid by consumers, they've said, and they discourage free trade, and we want more! Because free trade has broadly led to more global economic growth.<br /><br />But global trade hasn't been all positive for Americans, and in the worldview of President Trump's administration, tariffs can be used to right some of those wrongs. And the U.S. has economic leverage. So if the U.S. wants to level the playing field, it should use that leverage, and use tariffs to accomplish its policy goals.<br /><br />Today on the show: the case for tariffs. We talk to a lonely economist who's been sounding the alarm for years that more and free-er trade isn't always better. And we speak to economists in President Trump's orbit who make the case for how tariffs can be a potent economic and political tool.<br /><br /><em>This episode was produced by Willa Rubin and edited by Meg Cramer.

        "description": "There's one statistic that rules them all when it comes to keeping track of the economy: gross domestic product (GDP). It's the sum of all final transactions, so all the goods or services bought and sold, in an economy. GDP tells us how hot the economy is running, or how cool \u2014 like if we might be heading into a recession. And it's an important tool to compare countries, policies, and politicians. It's used by the U.S. government to allocate money and by businesses to make decisions about the future. <br /><br />For close to a century the building blocks of GDP have been the same. Now Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5323155/economic-data-reliability-trump-howard-lutnick\">proposed</a> a big change: taking government spending out of GDP. <br /><br />On today's show, can the U.S. change how it measures GDP? We talk with a former head of the BEA \u2014 about what he thinks they're likely to do now, and about the pressure he faced while trying to compile GDP for nearly two decades.

        "description": "Last year, Tyson Foods shuttered a meat processing plant in Perry, Iowa. The company said it made the decision because the plant was old and inefficient. But the closure was devastating for the residents of Perry. The plant had employed some 1200 workers in a town with a population of only 8000.<br /><br />At the same time, Tyson was also busy hiring workers elsewhere. It was working with a non-profit group that helps connect companies with asylum seekers and refugees looking for work. Tyson ultimately hired hundreds of new workers through this partnership.<br /><br />Was this just a coincidence? Or were these two stories actually one story - a story about one of the country's biggest meat processors forcing out American workers and replacing them with migrants? On today's show we take a look at the controversy surrounding Tyson's hiring moves and how things look from the perspective of the workers themselves.<br /><em><br />Find more </em>Planet Money<em>: </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3h92GwS\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3FqLuws\"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3sGZdrq\"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> / Our weekly </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3zrFvUB\"><em>Newsletter</em></a><em>.<br /><br />Listen free at these links: </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3gTkQlR\"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3Bkb17W\"><em>the NPR app</em></a><em> or anywhere you get podcasts.<br /><br />Help support </em>Planet Money<em> and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to </em>Planet Money<em>+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

It's the story of Long Term Capital Management.<br /><br />The story begins back in the 90s. A group of math nerds figured out how to use a mathematical model to identify opportunities in the market, tiny price discrepancies, that they could bet big on. Those bets turned into big profits, for them and their clients. They were the toast of Wall Street; it looked like they'd solved the puzzle of risk-taking. But their overconfidence in their strategy led to one of the biggest financial implosions in U.S. history, and destabilized the entire market.<br /><br />On today's show, what happens when perfect math meets the mess of human nature?

Tigran is a former IRS Special Agent. He made his name investigating high-profile dark web and cryptocurrency cases. Some colleagues called him the 'Crypto Wizard' because of his pioneering work tracing crypto transactions for law enforcement. Since 2021, he's worked at the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance.<br /><br />Tigran was in Nigeria as a sort of envoy. He was supposed to meet with government officials and show them that Binance \u2013 <em>and crypto itself</em> \u2013 was safe, reliable, and law-abiding.<br /><br />One of the most important meetings was at the headquarters of the Office of the National Security Advisor. He says officials there made him wait hours. And when officials finally came into the room, they accused Binance of a host of crimes and of tanking the Nigerian economy. They then told Tigran that they weren't going to let him leave Nigeria until they were satisfied that Binance was going to remedy the situation.<br /><br />On today's show, in a collaboration with <a href=\"https://therecord.media/podcast\"><em>Click Here from Recorded Future News</em></a>, we hear about Tigran's eight month detention in Nigeria.

The Spanish galleon weighed more than a thousand tons, was made of wood reinforced with iron, and featured three masts and 64 cannons. In its cargo were gold, silver, silk and porcelain. But in 1708, it sank after a battle with an English ship near what is now Colombia.<br /><br />For centuries, the shipwreck was the stuff of legends, until 2015 when underwater investigators found what they believed to be the San Jose's wreckage. The treasure on board this ship could be worth billions of dollars. But who owns it? Today on the show, four groups stake their claims to the wreck of the San Jose. Those claims reveal a lot about who has a say over the bottom of the sea and how we can begin to untangle the complicated legacy of colonialism.<br /><br /><em>This episode of Planet Money was hosted by Erika Beras and Mary Childs.

        "description": "Americans spend more on scratch lottery tickets per year than on pizza. More than <em>all</em> Coca-Cola products. Yet the scratch ticket as a consumer item has only existed for fifty years. Not so long ago, the idea of an instant lottery, of gambling with a little sheet of paper, was strange. Scary, even.<br /><br />So, how did scratch lotteries go from an idea that states wanted nothing to do with, to a commonplace item? It started in a small, super-liberal, once-puritanical state: Massachusetts. Adults there now spend \u2013 on average \u2013 $1,037 every year on lottery tickets \u2013 mostly scratch tickets. On today's episode, a collaboration with GBH's podcast <em>Scratch & Win</em>, we hear the story of... the scratch-off lottery ticket!<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Ian Coss and Kenny Malone. </em>Scratch & Win from GBH<em> is produced by Isabel Hibbard and edited by Lacy Roberts.

        "description": "On Monday, the stock market went into a tizzy over a new AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek. It seemed to be just as powerful as many of its American competitors, but its makers claimed to have made it far more cheaply, using far less computing power than similar AI apps like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. In one day, hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off the valuations of companies related to AI.<br /><br />This week, investors seemed suddenly to change their minds about what our AI future would look like and which companies will (or won't) profit from it. Will we really need all those high-end computer chips, after all? What about power plants to provide electricity for all the energy-hungry AI data centers? <br /><br />On today's show \u2013 how DeepSeek might have changed the economics of artificial intelligence forever.<br /><br /><em>This episode was produced by Willa Rubin with an assist from James Sneed.

        "description": "When it comes to solar and wind power, renewable energy has always had a caveat: it can only run when the wind blows or the sun shines.<br /><br />The idea of a battery was floated around to make renewables available 24/7. For years, it existed as an expensive, little-used technology. Then in 2021, it took off.<br /><br />In this episode, we explore how this new energy market works in two states: California and Texas.<br /><br />In California, there is now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes \u2014 at least for a few hours \u2014 and it's growing fast. What does this success mean for the grid, and how did the state support it?<br /><br />Then, we visit Texas, whose approach is more free-market rodeo. The state has the second-most battery storage capacity in the U.S. And in Texas, their system was recently put to the test. So, can these large-scale batteries can help prevent blackouts?<br /><br />These two stories come from our sister show <em>The Indicator</em>, which recently reported <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/1265481061/the-indicator-takes-on-batteries\">a series</a> about the electric battery market.<br /><br /><em>Today's show was hosted by Cooper Katz McKim, Darian Woods and Wailin Wong.

And why are so many of them alike?<br /><br />In the 1940s, if you were flying from New York City to London or Paris you would find yourself making a pit stop for fuel on the western coast of Ireland. The Shannon airport at the time wasn't much to look at, but the passengers arriving there were movie stars and celebrities, basically the super rich. And the people of Shannon realized pretty quickly that they needed to upgrade the local amenities for their wealthy clientele. They hired a man named Brendan O'Regan to make it happen. Being the quick-thinking entrepreneur that he was, O'Regan convinced the Irish government to create a tax loophole. And thus, duty free stores were born. <br /><br />Today on the show, we follow the surprising origin of duty free, and try to answer the question: Are they really saving you any money?<em><br /><br />Help support </em>Planet Money<em> and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to </em>Planet Money<em>+ in </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

        "description": "This year, there was some economic good news to go around. Inflation generally ticked down. Unemployment more or less held around 4-percent. Heck, the Fed even cut interest rates three times. But for a lot of people, the overall economic vibes were more important. And the vibes... were still off.<br /><br />We might have achieved the soft landing the Fed was hoping for, but we saw some wackiness in the relationship between unemployment and job vacancies. Meanwhile, Bitcoin went to the moon. We have covered all of that in this past year, but which of these economic stories really <em>defined</em> the year?<br /><br />Fortunately, we don't have to decide. You all do.<br /><br />On today's show, a collaboration with our daily podcast The Indicator, we have Indicator Family Feud! Two Planet Money hosts enter, one Indicator host... also enters. And all three leave, having had a great time with lively discussion and light ribbing. Plus, some mild scheduling issues. But, we can't stress enough that no hosts were harmed in the making of this podcast.<br /><br />Then, we look ahead to 2025 to see what indicators we think will define the coming year \u2013 the future and the past, on our latest episode!<br /><em><br />Help support </em>Planet Money<em> and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to </em>Planet Money<em>+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

There are a million species of plants and animals in danger of extinction, and the biggest cause is companies destroying their habitats to farm food, mine minerals, and otherwise get the raw materials to turn into the products we all consume.<br /><br />So, when Mauricio Serna was in college, he realized his family's plot of land in Colombia, called <em>El Globo</em>, presented a unique opportunity. Sure, it had historically been a cattle ranch. But if he could get the money to turn it back into cloud forest, perhaps it could once again be a habitat for the animals who used to live there \u2014 animals like the yellow-eared parrot, the tree ocelot, and the spectacled bear (of <em>Paddington</em> fame).<br /><br />On today's show, Mauricio's quest to make a market for a new-ish financial instrument: the biodiversity credit. We peek under the hood to try to figure out how these credits actually work. Is the hype around them a bunch of hot air? Or could they be a critical tool for saving thousands of species around the world?<br /><br /><em>Today's episode was hosted by Stan Alcorn and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.

Their work centered on a powerful \u2014 and almost radically obvious \u2014 idea: that the economic fate of nations is determined by how societies organize themselves. In other words, the economists shined a spotlight on the power of institutions, the systems, rules, and structures that shape society.<br /><br />We spoke with two of the Nobel-winning economists about their research on why some countries are rich and others are poor, why it took so long for economics to recognize the power of institutions, and what the heck those even are.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo and Greg Rosalsky.

He decided that the best thing he could do to protect his community was to go rogue and build his levees as tall as possible as quickly as possible, without federal permission.<br /><br />On today's show, what the story of Windell's levee can teach us about how the federal government calculates and manages the risk of natural disasters, and how those calculations can look a lot different to the people staring straight into the eye of the storm.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi and Mary Childs.

Opposing them in this trade was the Bank of England, which was determined to keep its currency stable. The financial battle that followed was intense and proved to be a watershed moment in the balance of power between markets and governments.<br /><br />On today's show, we speak to Robert Johnson, a former managing director at Soros' fund, for a blow-by-blow account of those fateful days in 1992. <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Alex Goldmark.

All of the land in this communal land is randomly reassigned to farmers who commit to farming it for the next decade.<br /><br />Hundreds of years ago, a community in Germany came up with their own, unique solution for how to best allocate scarce resources. For this community, the lottery is a way to try and make the system of land allotment more fair and avoid conflict.<br /><br />Today on the show, we go to the lottery and follow along as every farmer has a shot at getting the perfect piece of land \u2014 or the absolute worst piece of land! And we see what we can learn from this living, medieval tradition that tries to balance fairness and efficiency.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Emma Peaslee.

        "description": "This is the story behind one of the most valuable \u2014 and perhaps, most improbable \u2014 technologies humanity has ever created. It's a breakthrough called extreme ultraviolet lithography, and it's how the most advanced microchips in the world are made. The kind of chips powering the latest AI models. The kind of chips that the U.S. is desperately trying to keep out of the hands of China.<br /><br />For years, few thought this technology was even possible. It still sounds like science fiction: A laser strong enough to blast holes in a bank vault hits a droplet of molten tin. The droplet explodes into a burst of extreme ultraviolet light. That precious light is funneled onto a wafer of silicon, where it etches circuits as fine as a strand of DNA. Only one company in the world that can make these advanced microchip etching machines: a Dutch firm called ASML.<br /><br />Today on the show, how this breakthrough in advanced chipmaking happened \u2014 and how it almost didn't. How the long-shot idea was incubated in U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories and nurtured by U.S. tech giants. And, why a Dutch company now controls it.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo and Sally Helm. It was produced by Willa Rubin and edited by Jess Jiang.

Taking a page from economics textbooks, the state instituted a statewide \"cap and trade\" system for carbon emissions. The state establishes a <em>cap</em> on the total amount of carbon pollution it is willing to allow each year, and then gives away or auctions off carbon emission permits that add up to that total. Companies can then <em>trade </em>those permits on the open market.<br /><br />Economists love cap and trade plans because they establish a limit on carbon emissions while letting the market find the most efficient way for decarbonization to occur. But cap and trade has had a hard time catching on, especially in the U.S.<br /><br />The stakes are high for Washington's new plan. If it succeeds, it could convince other states to implement their own versions, but if it fails, it might serve as a cautionary tale. On today's show, we take a look at how Washington's grand experiment with cap and trade is faring.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Kenny Malone.

Grocery stores didn't have enough food. Hospitals didn't have basic supplies, like gauze. Child mortality was spiking. Businesses were shuttering. It's one of the epic economic collapses of our time. And it was totally avoidable.<br /><br />Venezuela used to be a relatively rich country. It has just about all the economic advantages a country could ask for: Beautiful beaches and mountains ready for tourism, fertile land good for farming, an educated population, and oil, lots and lots of oil.<br /><br />But during the boom years, the Venezuelan government made some choices that add up to an economic time bomb.<br /><br />Today on the show, we have an economic horror story about a country that made all the wrong decisions with its oil money. It's a window into the fundamental way that money works and how when you try to control it, you can lose everything.<br /><br />Then, an update on Venezuela today. How it went from a downward spiral, to a tentative economic stabilization... amidst political upheaval.<br /><br /><em>This original episode is hosted by Robert Smith and Noel King.

The government estimates that injuries from table saws send something like 30,000 people to the emergency room every year. 3,000 of those end in amputations. The costs of those injuries are enormous. Are they also avoidable?<br /><br />In 1999, inventor Steve Gass had a realization: Humans conduct electricity pretty well; Wood does not. Could he develop a saw that could tell the difference between the two?<br /><br />Steve invented a saw that can detect a finger and stop the blade in milliseconds. Then, he tried to license it to the big tool companies. He thought it was a slam dunk proposition: It would dramatically reduce the injuries, and the cost of medical treatments and lost wages associated with them.<br /><br />On today's episode: What does it take to make table saws safer? When someone gets hurt by a power tool, there are tons of costs, tons of externalities. We all bear the cost of the injury, in some way. So, it can be in society's best interest to minimize those costs. We follow Steve's quest to save thousands of fingers. It brought him face-to-face with roomfuls of power tool company defense attorneys, made him the anti-hero of the woodworking world, and cost the lives of many, many hot dogs.<br /><em><br />Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

        "description": "People often say that money can't buy you happiness. Sometimes, if you ask them to tell you more about it, they'll mention a famous 2010 study by Nobel Prize winners Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton. That study found that higher household income correlates with greater emotional well-being, but only up to around $75,000 a year. After that, more money didn't seem to matter.<br /><br />This was a famous study by two famous academics. The result stood for over a decade. And it feels good, right? Maybe the rich aren't so much happier than anyone else. But researchers have recently done a complete 180 on this idea. In 2021, psychologist Matt Killingsworth found nearly the opposite: That more money <em>does</em> correlate with more happiness. And that the relationship continues well beyond $75,000 per year.<br /><br />Today on the show: Does more money mean <em>fewer</em> problems? Two researchers with totally different takes come together to hammer out a better understanding of the relationship between money and happiness.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Sally Helm and Nick Fountain.

        "description": "When David Rashid took over US autoparts maker Plews and Edelmann, the company was losing business to its Chinese rival, Qingdao Sunsong. Both companies make power steering hoses, but Sunsong was offering its hoses to retailers at a much lower price.<br /><br />Then, in 2018, the Trump administration threw companies like Rashid's a lifeline, by announcing tariffs on a range of Chinese goods, including some autoparts. Rashid thought the tariffs would finally force Sunsong to raise its prices, but, somehow, the company never did.<br /><br />It was a mystery. And it led Rashid to take on a new role \u2013 amateur trade fraud investigator. How could his competitor, Sunsong, absorb that 25% tax without changing its prices? And why had all of Sunsong's steering hoses stopped coming from China and started coming from Thailand?<br /><br />On today's episode, the wide gulf between how tariffs work in theory... and how they actually work in practice. And David Rashid's quest to figure out what, if anything, he could do about it. It's a quest that will involve international detectives, forensic chemists, and a friendship founded on a shared love for hummus.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Jeff Guo.

Flash forward a decade or so, and the financial picture was still looking pretty good as America emerged from the first World War. <br /><br />But then, everything came crashing down with the stock market collapse of 1929. Businesses closed, banks collapsed, one in four people was unemployed, families couldn't make rent, the economy was broken. And this was happening all over the world.

And this is a story about the potential risks of putting your money into these apps.<br /><br />Banks go through a whole regulatory gauntlet in order to exist. But, in the past several years, there has been a rise in fintechs that skirt regulations. And many of these pose a real threat to even the most savvy of depositors.<br /><br />When a little known tech company filed for bankruptcy a few months ago, thousands of people couldn't access the millions of dollars they saved.

China had been wrecked by a brutal civil war. Taiwan became the home of people fleeing from that conflict. Japan and Korea were rebuilding after their own wars. And then in the later half of the twentieth century, they started their comeback. The governments made some explicit choices that unleashed the power of individual incentives and free market forces and lifted millions of people out of poverty. We focus specifically on China and Taiwan during this time, when they showed a burst of economic progress rarely seen on this globe. Why then? Why there? Can other nations copy that?

But for the new Olympic sport of breaking (if you want to be cool, don't call it breakdancing), the criteria aren't quite that straightforward. How do you judge an event whose core values are dopeness, freshness, and breaking the rules? <br /><br />That was the challenge for Storm and Renegade, two legendary b-boys who set out to create a fair and objective scoring system for a dance they say is more of an art than a sport. Over the years, their journey to define the soul of breaking led them to meetings with Olympics bigwigs, debates over the science of dopeness, and a battle with a question many sports \u2014 from figure skating to gymnastics \u2014 have tried to answer: Can art and sport coexist? <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.

An early use of money was to make trade easier. Trade was responsible for the birth of companies and the stock market. And trade was the lifeblood of the early United States.<br /><br />Today's episode covers 250 years of trade history in three chapters. We start with one of the founding texts of economics, <em>Wealth of Nations, </em>in which Adam Smith argues a country's true value is not measured in gold and silver, but by its people's ability to buy things that enhance their standard of living. Then we'll watch American politicians completely ignore that argument in favor of protecting domestic industries \u2013 until one congressman makes a passionate case for free trade as the means to world peace. And finally we'll follow the trade debate up to the modern day, where the tides of American politics have turned toward regulation.<br /><br /><em>This series is hosted by Robert Smith and produced by Audrey Dilling.

Should there be a centralized bank? Should there be a single currency? We'll travel to two moments in the country's early history when the founders said \"nope\" to these questions and see what happened. <br /><br />First we'll witness one of the great economic battles in U.S. history \u2013 the president of the United States versus the president of the <em>Bank</em> of the United States \u2013 and see how the outcome ushered in an age of financial panics. Then we'll drop in on a time before the U.S. dollar existed as we know it, when you could buy things using one of about 8,000 forms of money circulating in the country. We watch as the Civil War leads to the first standard currency. Along the way, we'll learn why the cycle of economic booms and busts persists to today despite efforts to centralize America's economy throughout history. <br /><br /><em>This episode was edited by Planet Money Executive Producer Alex Goldmark and fact-checked by Sofia Shchukina.  <br /><br />Subscribe to Planet Money+ for sponsor-free episode listening </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

It was run by the owner, maybe the spouse and the kids. Maybe they borrowed money from friends and relatives, but there was only so big it could get. Then came what can only be described as the big bang of economics. Over the span of a few decades, people figured out a way for businesses to sell ownership shares \u2013 otherwise known as stocks \u2013 and let people trade those shares. There was suddenly money to buy machines and expand. <br /><br />Today, we head to the Netherlands around the year 1600.

But for now, all we've got are clues, little breadcrumbs that she has dropped throughout her career that might lead us to a rough idea of what economic policies she might support. <br /><br />Today on the show, we're going to visit three key moments from Harris' political career that might give us an idea of how her economic agenda might look. First, the 2019 presidential primary debates, where she laid out her own economic policies. Next, a vote in her Senate years that shows where she might fall on future trade agreements. And finally, a fight with some of the country's biggest banks from her very first year as Attorney General of California. <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Nick Fountain.

All the colors, across files on Adobe products like Photoshop and Illustrator, were gone. Who had taken the colors away? The story of what happened begins with one company, Pantone.<br /><br />Pantone is known for their Color of the Year forecasts, but they actually make the bulk of their money from selling color reference guides. These guides are the standard for how designers pretty much anywhere talk about color.<br /><br />On today's show, how did Pantone come to control the language of the rainbow? We look back at the history of Pantone, beginning with the man who made Pantone into the industry standard. And, we hear from Stuart, who tried to break the color monopoly. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://forms.gle/5ZqsnQFdP9SEyYF97\"><em>Share your thoughts</em></a><em> \u2014 What color should we choose to be Planet Money's color? <br /><br />This episode was hosted by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler and Jeff Guo, and produced by Willa Rubin with help from James Sneed.

Today, we look at two key moments when the power of labor shifted, for better and worse, and we ask why then? What does history have to say about labor power right now? <br /><br />We travel to Sicily, Italy in the year 1347, where the bubonic plague is about to strike. The horror known as the Black Death will remake European society in countless ways, but we'll focus on one silver lining: how economic conditions shifted for workers. <br /><br />Then we head about 500 years into the future, to an English factory at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, where textile workers take up arms against the machines taking their jobs and show how rapidly labor supply and demand can change. This is the famed tale of the Luddites, now a byword for knee jerk anti-technology, but the true story has nuance and a desperate but rational violent rebellion. <br /><br /><em>This series is hosted by Robert Smith and produced by Audrey Dilling.

        "description": "4.5 million households in the U.S. have solar panels on their homes. Most of those customers are happy with it - their electricity bills have just about disappeared, and it's great for the planet. But thousands and thousands of people are really disappointed with what they've been sold. Their panels are more expensive than they should be, and they say it is hard to get someone to come fix them when they break. <br /><br />It turns out this sometimes crummy customer experience is no accident. It ties back to how big, national solar companies built their businesses in the first place. To entice people to install expensive solar panels, companies developed new financing models which cut upfront costs for customers. And they deployed lots and lots of salespeople to grow their businesses. But in the drive to get more households installing solar panels, consumer costs went up and the focus seemed to shift away from making sure those panels actually worked. All of this left some consumers feeling like they've been sold a lie.<br /><br />On today's episode, we look into how the residential solar business model has turned some people sour on solar. And we'll try to figure out where the industry could go from here. <br /><br /><em>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

        "description": "We often hear that air travel is worse than it's ever been. Gone are the days when airplanes touted piano bars and meat carving stations \u2014 or even free meals. Instead we're crammed into tiny seats and fighting for overhead space. <br /><br />How did we get here? Most of the inconveniences we think about when we fly can be traced back to the period of time just after the federal government deregulated the airlines. <br /><br />When commercial air travel took off in the 1940s, the government regulated how many national airlines were allowed to exist, where they were allowed to fly, and how much they could charge for tickets. But the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 swept all these restrictions aside \u2013 and stopped providing subsidies for the air carriers. Airlines had to compete on ticket prices. That competition led to a more bare-bones flying experience, but it also made air travel a lot more affordable. <br /><br />In this episode, we trace the evolution of air travel over the past century to discover whether flying really is worse today \u2014 or if it's actually better than ever. We'll board a plane from the \"golden age\" of air travel, hear the history of one of the original budget airlines and meet feuding airline CEOs. Along the way, we'll see how economic forces have shaped the airline industry into what it is today, and what role we, as consumers, have played. <br /><br /><em>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

He runs a space company and wants to colonize mars. He also runs a company that just implanted a computer chip into a human brain. And he believes there's a pretty high probability everything is a simulation and we are living inside of it.<br /><br />But the latest Elon Musk headline-grabbing drama is less something out of sci-fi, and more something pulled from HBO's \"Succession.\"<br /><br />Elon Musk helped take Tesla from the brink of bankruptcy to one of the biggest companies in the world. And his compensation for that was an unprecedentedly large pay package that turned him into the richest person on Earth. But a judge made a decision about that pay package that set off a chain of events resulting in quite possibly the most expensive, highest stakes vote in publicly traded company history.<br /><br />The ensuing battle over Musk's compensation is not just another wild Elon tale. It's a lesson in how to motivate the people running the biggest companies that \u2013 like it or not \u2013 are shaping our world. It's a classic economics problem with a very 2024 twist.<br /><br /><em>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

But true fans of graphite would be shouting out \"batteries!\" Because graphite is a key ingredient in another important thing that we all use in our everyday lives: lithium ion batteries.<br /><br />Almost all of the battery-ready graphite in the world comes from one place: China. That's actually true of lots of the materials that go into batteries, like processed lithium and processed cobalt. Which is why it was such a big deal when, earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/14/remarks-by-president-biden-remarks-by-president-biden-on-his-actions-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/\">President Biden announced a tariff package</a> that will make a bunch of Chinese imports more expensive. Included in this package are some tariffs on Chinese graphite. He wants to create a new battery future\u2014one that doesn't rely so much on China. <br /><br />In this episode, we get down on the ground to look at this big supply chain story through the lens of one critical mineral. And we visit a small town that realizes that it might be the perfect place to create an American graphite industry. And we find that declaring a new battery future is one thing, but making it happen is another thing entirely. <br /><em><br />Help support </em>Planet Money<em> and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to </em>Planet Money<em>+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

        "description": "Most economic textbooks will tell you that there can be real dangers in running up a big national debt. A major concern is how the debt you add now could slow down economic growth in the future. Economists have not been able to nail down how much debt a country can safely take on. But they have tried.<br /><br />Back in 2010, two economists took a look at 20 countries over the course of decades, and sometimes centuries, and came back with a number. Their analysis suggested that economic growth slowed significantly once national debt passed 90% of annual GDP... and that is when the fight over debt and growth really took off.<br /><br />On today's episode: a deep dive on what we know, and what we don't know, about when exactly national debt becomes a problem. We will also try to figure out how worried we should be about the United States' current debt total of 26 trillion dollars.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Nick Fountain.

You had to get a cow, raise the cow, feed the cow, kill the cow, get the fat out of the cow, cook the fat, dip wicks into the fat. All that--for not very much light. Now, if we want to light a whole room, we just flip a switch.<br /><br />The history of light explains why the world today is the way it is. It explains why we aren't all subsistence farmers, and why we can afford to have artists and massage therapists and plumbers. (And, yes, people who make podcasts about the history of light.) The history of light is the history of economic growth--of things getting faster, cheaper, and more efficient.<br /><br />On today's show: How we got from dim little candles made out of cow fat, to as much light as we want at the flick of a switch.<br /><br /><em>Today's show was hosted by Jacob Goldstein and David Kestenbaum.

For years, law enforcement has been frustrated with encrypted messaging apps, like Signal and Telegram. And law enforcement has been even more frustrated by encrypted phones, specifically designed to thwart authorities from snooping. <br /><br />But in 2018, in a story that seems like it's straight out of a spy novel, the FBI was approached with an offer: Would they like to get into the encrypted cell phone business? What if they could convince criminals to use their phones to plan and document their crimes \u2014 all while the FBI was secretly watching? It could be an unprecedented peek into the criminal underground. <br /><br />To pull off this massive sting operation, the FBI needed to design a cell phone that criminals wanted to use and adopt. Their mission: to make a tech platform for the criminal underworld. And in many ways, the FBI's journey was filled with all the hallmarks of many Silicon Valley start-ups. <br /><br />On this show, we talk with journalist <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/author/joseph-cox/\">Joseph Cox</a>, who wrote a new book about the FBI's cell phone business, called <a href=\"https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/joseph-cox/dark-wire/9781541702691/\"><em>Dark Wire</em></a>.

We're just changing priorities, making a strategic shift.\" <br /><br />It's like the business version of: \"It's not you, it's me.\" And just like a breakup, it feels terrible. <br /><br />This happened to a man we're calling V, who was working at the same company as his husband when he got laid off. And for V, the experience felt shocking. It left him and his husband with a lot of unresolved questions. <br /><br />On today's show, the story of that layoff.

Computers that power the internet. Computers used by banks and airlines and even the military. <br /><br />What these computers had in common was that they all relied on open source software. <br /><br />A strange fact about modern life is that most of the computers responsible for it are running open source software. That is, software mostly written by unpaid, sometimes even anonymous volunteers. Some crucial open source programs are managed by just <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2347/\">a single overworked programmer</a>. And as the world learned last month, these programs can become attractive targets for hackers. <br /><br />In this case, the hackers had infiltrated a popular open source program called XZ. Slowly, over the course of two years, they transformed XZ into a secret backdoor. And if they hadn't been caught, they could have taken control of large swaths of the internet. <br /><br />On today's show, we get the story behind the XZ hack and what made it possible. How the hackers took advantage of the strange way we make modern software.

But, in 2022, <em>support </em>for unions among Americans was the <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/398303/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20D.C.%20%2D%2D%20Seventy%2Done,on%20this%20measure%20since%201965\">highest</a> it's been in decades. This dissonance is due, in part, to the difficulties of one important phase in the life cycle of a union: setting up a union in the first place. One place where that has been particularly clear is at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.<br /><br />Back in 2008, Volkswagen announced that they would be setting up production in the United States after a 20-year absence. They planned to build a new auto manufacturing plant in Chattanooga. <br /><br />Volkswagen has plants all over the world, all of which have some kind of worker representation, and the company said that it wanted that for Chattanooga too. So, the United Auto Workers, the union that traditionally represents auto workers, thought they would be able to successfully unionize this plant. <br /><br />They were wrong.<br /><br />In this episode, we tell the story of the UAW's 10-year fight to unionize the Chattanooga plant. And, what other unions can learn from how badly that fight went for labor. <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Nick Fountain. It was produced by Willa Rubin.

That is a really big deal, because it means that one of the spookiest stories in modern economics might finally have an ending. <br /><br />Back in the 1980s, Japan performed something of an economic miracle. It transformed itself into the number two economy in the world. From Walkmans to Toyotas, the U.S. was awash in Japanese imports. And Japanese companies went on a spending spree. Sony bought up Columbia Pictures. Mitsubishi became the new majority owners of Rockefeller Center. <br /><br />But in the early 1990s, it all came to a sudden halt. Japan went from being one of the fastest growing countries in the world to one of the slowest. And this economic stagnation went on and on and on. For decades. <br /><br />On this episode, the unnerving story of Japan's Lost Decades: How did one of the most advanced economies in the world just fall down one day \u2014 and not be able to get up? Japan's predicament changed our understanding of what can go wrong in a modern economy. And gave us some new tools to try and deal with it. <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo.

        "description": "In 2019, Mike Ketchmark got a call. Mike is a lawyer in Kansas City, Missouri, and his friend, Brandon Boulware, another lawyer, was calling about a case he wanted Mike to get involved with. Mike was an unusual choice - he's a personal injury lawyer, and this was going to be an antitrust case. <br /><br />But Brandon knew Mike was great in front of a jury. And that he'd won huge settlements for his clients in the past. <br /><br />So the lawyer friend drops by Mike's office, and pitches him the case. Rhonda and Scott Burnett had just sold their home for $250,000, and out of that amount, they had paid $15,000 in commission (plus a small fee), which was split between two real estate agents - even though they had hired only one. And the commission was high - 6%. Mike's friend said the whole thing seemed... suspicious. Maybe even illegal. <br /><br />Mike agreed to take the case, a case that would soon become bigger than one about just what had happened to the Burnetts. It would become a fight about the way homes are bought and sold in the U.S. and challenge the way real estate agents have done business for more than 100 years. <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Keith Romer.

And some taxpayers have concerns about how they might be funding weapons that have been used to kill civilians in Gaza. And there are questions about how much individual taxpayers contribute to war efforts, generally. <br /><br />So in this episode, we attempt to do the math: The average taxpayers' contribution to Israel and Ukraine.

The company, which launched in the fall of 2022, has been flooding the American advertising market, buying much of the inventory of Facebook, Snapchat, and beyond. According to the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Temu is one of the most downloaded iPhone apps in the country, with around 50 million monthly active users.<br /><br />On today's show, we go deep on Temu: How does it work, how did it manage such a quick rise in the U.S., and what hints might it offer us about the future of retail? Plus, we'll talk to the bicycle-loving U.S. Representative who is working to shut down a loophole that has proved very helpful to Temu's swift ascent. <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Nick Fountain and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi with reporting from Emily Feng.

It was one of the biggest employers, a driver of economic growth, and it shaped our national security. Cars, weapons, skyscrapers... all needed steel.<br /><br />But in the second half of the 20th century, the industry's power started to decline. Foreign steel companies gained more market power and the established steel industry in the U.S. was hesitant to change and invest in newer technologies. But then, a smaller company took a chance and changed the industry. <br /><br />On today's episode: What can the fall of a once-great industry teach us about innovation and technology?

        "description": "When you buy a bottle of rum in the United States, by law nearly all the federal taxes on that rum must be sent to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It's an unusual system that Congress designed decades ago to help fund these two U.S. territories. In 2021 alone, these rum tax payments added up to more than $700 million.<br /><br />Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands split the money according to how much rum each territory produces. And the territories produce a lot of it \u2014 especially Puerto Rico, which single handedly supplies the majority of the rum that Americans drink.<br /><br />But in 2008, the U.S. Virgin Islands pulled off a coup. It convinced one of the largest rum brands in the world, Captain Morgan, to abandon Puerto Rico and to shift its operations to the tiny island of St. Croix.<br /><br />This was the beginning of the Rum Wars.<br /><br />On today's show, the story of how a scheme designed to help Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands turned them into bitter rivals. And how it ended up putting hundreds of millions of dollars a year \u2014 U.S. taxpayer dollars \u2014 into the pockets of big liquor companies instead.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo and Sarah Gonzalez.

It's showing signs of boom and bust seemingly all at once. <br /><br />The story of wind energy markets in two acts today. First, the Gulf of Mexico saw its first-ever auction of leases for offshore wind this summer. It was another sign of the Biden administration's desire to get more renewable energy online as fast as possible. Expectations were high, but results did not deliver. Two of the three patches of sea didn't get any bids at all. Hidden in the flop for this auction are some keys to what it takes to spark a whole new market, quickly. <br /><br />Then, the booming side of wind power: the job that's projected to be the fastest-growing in the U.S. is wind turbine service technician. Is it a \"good\" job?

American supermarkets. <br /><br />Why is that? Why shouldn't the prices for meat or bread or produce go down as they get older? Why does all the milk in the store cost the same, even when the \"sell by\" dates are weeks apart? Wouldn't a little more flexibility around prices be better for customers and help reduce waste?<br /><br />Professors Robert Evan Sanders and Ioannis (Yannis) Stamatopoulus had similar questions.

The U.S. is one of just a handful of countries worldwide with no federal paid parental leave; it offers functionally no public childcare (and private childcare is wildly expensive); and women can expect their pay to take a hit after becoming a parent. (Incidentally, men's wages tend to rise after becoming fathers.) <br /><br />But outside the U.S., many countries desperately want kids to be born inside their borders. One reason? Many countries are facing a looming problem in their population demographics: they have a ton of aging workers, fewer working-age people paying taxes, and not enough new babies being born to become future workers and taxpayers. And some countries are throwing money at the problem, offering parents generous benefits, even including straight-up cash for kids. <br /><br />So if the U.S. makes it very hard to have kids, but other countries are willing to pay you for having them....maybe you can see the opportunity here. Very economic, and very pregnant, host Mary Childs did. Which is why she went benefits shopping around the world.

The idea is that they might be able to supercharge growth by giving money to certain kinds of businesses, or by putting up trade barriers to protect certain industries. Economists have long been against it. Industrial policy has been called a \"taboo\" subject, and \"one of the most toxic phrases\" in economics. The mainstream view has been that industrial policy is inefficient, even harmful. <br /><br />For a long time, politicians largely accepted that view. But in the past several years, countries have started to embrace industrial policy\u2014most notably in the United States. Under President Biden, the U.S. is set to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on industrial policy, to fund things like microchip manufacturing and clean energy projects. It's one of the most ambitious tests of industrial policy in U.S. history. And the billion dollar question is ... will it work? <br /><br />On today's show, R\u00e9ka takes us on a fun, nerdy journey to explain the theory behind industrial policy, why it's so controversial, and where President Biden's big experiment might be headed.<br /><br /><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

And that's when he learned about a very old type of lawsuit, called a heart balm tort. A lawsuit that would let him sue the man his now ex-wife had gotten involved with during their marriage.<br /><br />On this episode, where heart balm torts came from, what relationships looked like back then, and why these lawsuits still exist today (in some states, anyway.)

For example: Surrogacy is a legal industry in parts of the United States, but not in much of the rest of the world. Assisted end-of-life is a legal medical transaction in some states, but is illegal in others.<br /><br />When we have those knee-jerk reactions and our gut repels us from considering something apparently icky, economics asks us to look a little more closely. <br /><br />Today on the show, we have three recommendations of things that may feel kinda wrong but economics suggests may actually be the better way. First: Could the matching process of organ donation be more efficient if people could buy and sell organs? Then: Should women seek revenge more often in the workplace? And finally, what if insider trading is actually useful? <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Mary Childs and Greg Rosalsky. It was produced by Willa Rubin and edited by Jess Jiang.

        "description": "At around 1 a.m. on the morning of November 15, 1994, Captain Prentice \"Skip\" Strong III woke to a distress call. Skip was the new captain of an oil tanker called the <em>Cherry Valley</em>. He and his crew had been making their way up the coast of Florida that evening when a tropical storm had descended. It had been a rough night of 15 foot waves and 50 mile per hour winds.<br /><br />The distress call was coming from a tugboat whose engines were failing in the storm. Now adrift, the tugboat was on a dangerous collision course with the shore. The only ship close enough to mount a rescue was the <em>Cherry Valley.</em> <br /><br />Skip faced a difficult decision. A fully loaded, 688-foot oil tanker is hardly anyone's first choice of a rescue vessel. It is as maneuverable as a school bus on ice. And the <em>Cherry Valley </em>was carrying ten million gallons of heavy fuel oil. A rescue attempt would put them in dangerously shallow water. One wrong move, and they would have an ecological disaster on the order of the <em>Exxon Valdez</em>. <br /><br />What happened next that night would be dissected and debated for years to come. The actions of Skip and his crew would lead to a surprising discovery, a record-setting lawsuit, and one of the strangest legal battles in maritime history. At the center of it all, an impossible question: How do you put a price tag on doing the right thing?<br /><em><br />Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

This includes oil tankers and massive container ships transporting everything from microchips to furniture. With Houthi rebels attacking container ships in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, shipping lines are re-routing, adding time and cost to delivery. We look at how ocean shipping is a web more than a chain of links, and try to see which parts of the web can take up more strain as the Red Sea and the Suez Canal become too dangerous to pass. <br /><br />Then, we'll consider what escalation could mean for the region's most important export: oil. Five steps of escalation each mean a ratcheting up of costs that knock on to other industries, like food. Some prices are likely to rise faster than others, though. <br /><br />Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in <a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\">Apple Podcasts</a> or at <a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\">plus.npr.org/planetmoney</a>.<br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

        "description": "When you think of a potato, one state probably comes to mind: Idaho. But for much of American history, Maine was home to the nation's largest potato crop. <br /><br />That status had changed by the 1970s, with the West growing more and more of the nation's potatoes. But Maine still had one distinct advantage: A privileged position in the commodities market. The New York Mercantile Exchange, one of the largest such marketplaces in the country, exclusively dealt in Maine potatoes. And two deep-pocketed Western potato kingpins weren't happy about it. <br /><br />So the Westerners waged what's now called the Maine Potato War of 1976. Their battlefield was the futures market: A special type of marketplace, made up of hordes of screaming traders, where potatoes can be bought and sold before they're even planted. <br /><br />The Westerners did something so bold \u2013 and so unexpected \u2013 that it brought not only the potato market, but the entire New York commodities exchange, to its knees. <br /><br />Today on the show, how a war waged through futures contracts influenced the kind of potatoes we eat. <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Dylan Sloan and Nick Fountain.

        "description": "There's this fundamental question in economics that has proven really hard to answer: What's a good way to help people out of poverty? The old-school way was to fund programs that would support very particular things, like buying cows for a village, giving people business training, or building schools.<br /><br />But over the past few decades, there has been a new idea: Could you help people who don't have money by ... just giving them money? We covered this question in a segment of <em>This American Life</em> that originally ran in <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/503/i-was-just-trying-to-help/act-one-1\">2013</a>. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/131/4/1973/2468874\">Economists who studied the question found</a> that giving people cash had positive effects on recipients' economic and psychological well-being. Maybe they bought a cow that could earn them money each week. Maybe they could replace their grass roofs with metal roofs that didn't need fixing every so often. <br /><br />The success of just giving people in poverty cash has spawned a whole set of new questions that economists are now trying to answer. Like, if we do just give money, what's the best way to do that? Do you just give it all at once? Or do you dole it out over time? And it turns out... <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/2023-ubi-results/\">a huge new study</a> on giving cash was just released and it's got a lot of answers.<br /><em><br />Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

High inflation has been plaguing the country and just surpassed 160% a year.<br /><br />Over the past couple of years, the local currency has collapsed. One U.S. dollar used to be worth 20 Argentinean pesos in 2018. Today, one U.S. dollar is worth 1,000 pesos on the black market. And that means for Argentineans, the real prices of everything \u2014 from groceries to gas \u2014 have spiked.<br /><br />In a country where the local currency is in free fall, promising to replace that currency with the US dollar can seem like a magical solution.<br /><br />Argentina's new president, Javier Milei, won in part by promising to do just that - to <em>dollarize</em>. To scrap Argentina's peso and replace it with the relatively stable, predictable, boring United States dollar.<br /><br />On today's show, what does dollarizing mean?

A crisis of chronic. <br /><br />And, jokes aside, it's a real problem for people who work in the cannabis industry like Matt Ochoa. Ochoa runs the Jefferson Packing House in Medford, Oregon, which provides marijuana growers with services like drying, trimming and packing their product. He has seen literal tons of usable weed being left in marijuana fields all over the state of Oregon. Because, Ochoa says, there aren't enough buyers. <br /><br />There are just over four million people in Oregon, and so far this year, farmers have grown 8.8 million pounds of weed. Which means there's nearly a pound of dried, smokable weed for every single person in the state of Oregon. As a result, the sales price for legal marijuana in the last couple of years has plummeted.<br /><br />Economics has a straightforward solution for Oregon's overabundance problem: trade! But, Oregon's marijuana can only be sold in Oregon. No one in any state can legally sell weed across state lines, because marijuana is still illegal under federal law.

        "description": "Here at Planet Money, Thanksgiving is not just a time to feast on turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green bean casseroles and pie(s). It's also a time to feast on economics. Today, we host a very Planet Money Thanksgiving feast, and solve a few economic questions along the way.<br /><br />First: a turkey mystery. Around the holidays, demand for turkey at grocery stores goes up by as much as 750%. And when turkey demand is so high, you might think that the price of turkey would also go up. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176523000575\">But data shows</a>, the price of whole turkeys actually falls around the holidays; it goes down by around 20%. So what's going on? The answer has to do what might be special about supply and demand around the holidays. <br /><br />We also reveal <a href=\"https://apps.bea.gov/scb/issues/2022/02-february/0222-household-production.htm\">what is counted (and not counted)</a> in the ways we measure the economy. <br /><br />And we look to <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-economicsciences2012.pdf\">economics</a> to help solve the perennial Thanksgiving dilemma: Where should each dinner guest sit? Who should sit next to whom? <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Jeff Guo. It was produced by James Sneed with an assist from Emma Peaslee and edited by Jess Jiang.

But then he realized how much in-depth knowledge GPT had of the books he had written. When prompted, it supplied detailed plot summaries and descriptions of even minor characters. He was convinced it could only pull that off if it had read his books.<br /><br />Large language models, the kind of artificial intelligence underlying programs like ChatGPT, do not come into the world fully formed. They first have to be trained on incredibly large amounts of text. Douglas Preston, and 16 other authors, including George R.R. Martin, Jodi Piccoult, and Jonathan Franzen, were convinced that their novels had been used to train GPT without their permission. So, in September, they sued OpenAI for copyright infringement.<br /><br />This sort of thing seems to be happening a lot lately\u2013one giant tech company or another \"moves fast and breaks things,\" exploring the edges of what might or might not be allowed without first asking permission.

        "description": "When Lina Khan was in law school back in 2017, she wrote a law review article called 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,' that went kinda viral in policy circles. In it, she argued that antitrust enforcement in the U.S. was behind the times. For decades, regulators had focused narrowly on consumer welfare, and they'd bring companies to court only when they thought consumers were being harmed by things like rising prices. But in the age of digital platforms like Amazon and Facebook, Khan argued in the article, the time had come for a more proactive approach to antitrust.<br /><br />Just four years later, President Biden appointed Lina Khan to be the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, one of the main government agencies responsible for enforcing antitrust in America, putting her in the rare position of putting some of her ideas into practice.<br /><br />Now, two years into the job, Khan has taken some big swings at big tech companies like Meta and Microsoft. But the FTC has also faced a couple of big losses in the courts. On today's show, a conversation with FTC Chair Lina Khan on what it's like to try to turn audacious theory into bureaucratic practice, the FTC's new lawsuit against Amazon, and what it all means for business as usual. <br /><br /><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

It's a big case, with implications for consumers and businesses and digital marketplaces, and for antitrust law itself. That is the highly important but somewhat obscure body of law that deals with competition and big business.<br /><br />And so, this week on Planet Money, we are doing a deep dive on the history of antitrust. It begins with today's episode, a Planet Money double feature. Two classic episodes that tell the story of how the U.S. government's approach to big business and competition has changed over time.<br /><br />First, the story of a moment more than 100 years ago, when the government stepped into the free market in a big way to make competition work. It's the story of John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil, and a muckraking journalist named Ida Tarbell.<br /><br />Then, we fast forward to a turning point that took antitrust in the other direction. This is the story of a lawyer named Robert Bork, who transformed the way courts would interpret antitrust law.<br /><br /><em>These episodes were produced by Sally Helm with help from Alexi Horowitz Ghazi.

This dissonance is due, in part, to the difficulties of one important phase in the life cycle of a union: setting up a union in the first place. One place where that has been particularly clear is at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.<br /><br />Back in 2008, Volkswagen announced that they would be setting up production in the United States after a 20-year absence. They planned to build a new auto manufacturing plant in Chattanooga. <br /><br />Volkswagen has plants all over the world, all of which have some kind of worker representation, and the company said that it wanted that for Chattanooga too. So, the United Auto Workers, the union that traditionally represents auto workers, thought they would be able to successfully unionize this plant. <br /><br />They were wrong.<br /><br />In this episode, we tell the story of the UAW's 10-year fight to unionize the Chattanooga plant. And, what other unions can learn from how badly that fight went for labor. <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Nick Fountain. It was produced by Willa Rubin.

But the University may not have known what it was in for. In her speech, Bamford told the crowd of graduates how much the university offered to pay her (nothing), her counteroffer ($20,000), and the amount they settled on ($10,000), which (after taxes and fees, etc.) she gave away to students in the audience to pay down their student loans.<br /><br />Maria Bamford is a big believer in full disclosure of her finances, a philosophy she's adopted after decades in a Debtors Anonymous support group. In meetings, she learned important financial tips and tricks to go from thousands of dollars in debt to her current net worth of $3.5 million (a number which, true to her philosophy, she will share with anyone).<br /><br />She spoke with us about her financial issues, how she recovered, and why she believes in total financial transparency, even when it makes her look kinda bad.<br /><br /><em>Disclaimer: Planet Money is not qualified or certified to give financial advice.

It would be better for the climate, and, he thought, in the long run it would be the most economical choice Uruguay could make.<br /><br />M\u00e9ndez Galain shared his plan online and in a series of informal lectures. Then, one day he received a phone call from the office of the president of Uruguay, inviting him to put his plan into action.<br /><br />Countries all over the world have announced lofty goals to reduce the emissions that cause climate change.

While Alaska Airlines technically couldn't fire someone on strike, they could permanently replace the striking flight attendants with new workers. Essentially, if the union went on strike, they could risk thousands of people's jobs. The flight attendants knew they needed a counter-strategy.<br /><br />They went with a strategy they called CHAOS: \"Create Havoc Around Our System.\"<br /><br />The strategy had two phases. Phase one: The union kept Alaska guessing about when, where, and how a strike might happen. They kept everyone, even their own members, in the dark. And in turn, Alaska Airlines had to be prepared for a strike at any place and any time. Phase two was to go on strike in a targeted and strategic way.<br /><br />The havoc that the flight attendants created set off a sort-of labor-dispute arms race and would go on to inspire strikes today.

It's a pretty standard headshot \u2014 it's in black-and-white, and Prince is staring down the camera lens.<br /><br />This was early in his career, when he was still building the pop icon reputation he would have today. And in 1984, shortly after Prince had released <em>Purple Rain</em>, he was chosen to grace the cover of Vanity Fair. The magazine commissioned pop culture icon Andy Warhol to make a portrait of Prince for the cover. He used Lynn Goldsmith's photo, created a silkscreen from it, added some artistic touches, and instead of black-and-white, colored the face purple and set it against a red background. Warhol was paid, Goldsmith was paid, and both were given credit.<br /><br />However, years later, after both Prince and Warhol had passed away, Goldsmith saw her portrait back out in the world again. But this time, the face was orange, and Goldsmith wasn't given money or credit. And what began as a typical question of payment for work, led to a firestorm in the Supreme Court. At the center of it, dozens of questions of what makes art unique. And at what point does a derivative work become transformative? The answer, it seems, has to do less with what art critics think, and more with what the market thinks.<em><br /><br />Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

        "description": "Back in the 1990s, Dr. Raghunath Mashelkar was in his office in New Delhi when he came across a puzzling story in the newspaper. Some university scientists in the U.S. had apparently filed a patent for using turmeric to help heal wounds. Mashelkar was shocked, because he knew that using turmeric that way was a well known remedy in traditional Indian medicine. And he knew that patents are for brand new inventions. So, he decided to do something about it \u2013 to go to battle against the turmeric patent.<br /><br />But as he would soon discover, turmeric wasn't the only piece of traditional or indigenous knowledge that had been claimed in Western patent offices. The practice even had its own menacing nickname - <em>biopiracy</em>. And what started out as a plan to rescue one Indian remedy from the clutches of the U.S. patent office, eventually turned into a much bigger mission \u2013 to build a new kind of digital fortress, strong enough to keep even the most rapacious of bio-pirates at bay.<br /><br /><em>This episode was produced by Willa Rubin with help from James Sneed and Emma Peaslee.

        "description": "Across Hollywood right now, writers and actors are picketing in front of studio lots. They're walking back and forth, holding up signs demanding concessions on things like pay, how many writers work on projects, and the use of AI in TV and movies.<br /><br />But, on some of these lots, there are these strange <em>alternate</em> entrances where there are no picketers. Here drivers can come and go as they please without ever encountering any sign of a strike.<br /><br />Behold the neutral gate. An entrance intended for people who work at these lots but <em>don't</em> work for production companies that are involved with these particular strikes. (Usually that means things like game shows or TV commercials.)<br /><br />But, as one group of picketers recently experienced, it's hard to know if these entrances are, in fact, only being used by neutral parties or if the entrances might be being abused.<br /><br />On today's episode, the question of whether one Hollywood production was taking advantage of the neutral gate, and what the fight over a driveway can teach us about the broader labor battles in Hollywood and across the country.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Dave Blanchard and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi, with reporting from Kenny Malone.

For some, this is the ultimate economic choice.<br /><br />Every single worker in the European Union is guaranteed four weeks of paid vacation. No matter how long they've been at a company. No matter how low paying the job is. Vacation is a right.<br /><br />In fact, all but one of the richest countries in the world guarantees paid vacation, except: the U.S.<br /><br />According to a 2019 study, people in Japan get 10 paid vacation days and 15 paid holidays; in Australia it's 20 paid vacation days and 8 paid holidays; and in Spain it's 25 paid vacation days and 14 paid holidays.<br /><br />And it's not just a rich country thing: Mexico, Afghanistan, Thailand, Tanzania - they all guarantee paid vacation from work, at least in the formal job sector.<br /><br />In the U.S: Zero paid vacation days and zero paid holidays. So, why is the United States the outlier? We go to several labor economists and historians, to find out what makes Americans different from Europeans.

It's about modeling, and weighing the costs of messing up vs. missing out. For instance, take a newspaper vendor who has to decide how many newspapers to sell tomorrow morning. Do they buy fewer, knowing that they'll sell out\u2013and then miss out on potential revenue from papers not sold? Or do they order more than they expect to sell, just in case\u2013and eat the cost of a few unsold papers? This type of trade-off applies to all kinds of businesses, and Gallino talks us through how to choose.<br /><br />The only certainty in this life is uncertainty. But we are certain you will come out of this episode feeling better prepared for your future business.

        "description": "This summer, the Supreme Court struck down Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt for millions of borrowers. Except, on the same day Biden first announced that plan, he also unveiled <em>another, </em>the SAVE plan. And though SAVE sounded less significant than Biden's big forgiveness pledge, it's still alive and could erase even more student debt.<br /><br />SAVE is officially a loan repayment plan. But through a few seemingly minor yet powerful provisions, many more low-income borrowers will end up paying little or nothing until, eventually, their loans will be forgiven. Even many higher-income borrowers will see some of their debts erased.<br /><br />In this episode, we explain the history of income-driven repayment. And how borrowers could end up paying less than they might expect once payments resume in October.

        "description": "For anyone running a business, technology is both threat and opportunity. Today, we run through techniques entrepreneurs can use to take advantage of new tech or defend against the dangers. It's not just about the product you're selling. It's about consumer psychology, and ethics, and taking calculated risks to navigate uncertainty.<br /><br />But, since this is Planet Money Summer School and we want to set your business on the path to riches, we're going to talk about how to use tech to dream big. Maybe more than anything, technology creates opportunities for the little guys where the big established companies can't be so nimble or have too much to lose. <br /><br />Take the classic concept of the innovator's dilemma: a company that innovated and succeeded, now faces a choice about any disruptive new technology. Do they risk tossing out their existing advantage and switch to the new tech, or play it safe and risk becoming obsolete?<br /><br />Most new technologies don't end up disrupting an industry. So it is totally rational for the big existing companies to ignore each new flash in the pan. But nobody wants to end up like Kodak: sticking with film while the digital camera takes off. So what to do? <br /><br />Our friendly professor has a few ideas \u2013 for the little guy and the big old company. He'll explain the shape of how new technology gets adopted, sometimes called the S curve. We'll also hear examples of what stops promising new tech from taking off: from dishwashers to driverless cars, and even the humble elevator.<br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

Or will we end up with a hard landing, in which inflation comes down, but at the price of the country's economic health?

        "description": "Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino are two of the biggest stars in behavioral science.

The two worked together on a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1209746109\">paper</a> about how to \"nudge\" people to be more honest on things like forms or tax returns. Their trick: move the location where people attest that they have filled in a form honestly from the bottom of the form to the top.<br /><br />But recently, questions have arisen about whether the data Ariely and Gino relied on in their famous paper about honesty were fabricated \u2014 whether their research into honesty was itself built on lies. The blog Data Colada went looking for clues in the <a href=\"https://datacolada.org/109\">cells of the studies' Excel spreadsheets</a>, the <a href=\"https://datacolada.org/98\">shapes of their data distributions</a>, and even the fonts that were used.<br /><br />The Hartford, an insurance company that collaborated with Ariely on one implicated study, told NPR this week in a statement that it could confirm that the data it had provided for that study had been altered had been altered after they gave it to Ariely, but prior to the research's publication: \"It is clear the data was manipulated inappropriately and supplemented by synthesized or fabricated data.\" <br /><br />Ariely denies that he was responsible for the falsified data. \"Getting the data file was the extent of my involvement with the data,\" he told NPR.<br /><br /><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

Accounting gives you a sixth sense\u2013one that can help you determine whether your business will survive or fail.<br /><br />In this class, you'll learn the basics of accounting, and uncover its origins.

For them, new research can explain something they have always wondered about, or make them see something they have never noticed before. And it inspires their own work. <br /><br />So, to bring that same sense of discovery to you, the listener, today we are dedicating our show to a special experiment. A new way to share some of the most fascinating, clever and surprising economics papers in a segment we're calling: The Econ Paper Club.<br /><br />On today's show, we read the econ papers so you don't have to. We take a joyous romp through some of the most fascinating ideas floating around economics right now. And we find that some of those fascinating ideas are about some of the biggest things in life: the careers we choose, the expectations that come with parenting and what one eminent economist calls 'greedy jobs.' <br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Kenny Malone.

How long is the next recession going to last? How do we stop inflation without wrecking the rest of the economy? These questions are the domain of macroeconomics. But even some macroeconomists themselves admit: While we have many theories about how the economy works, we have very few satisfying answers.<br /><br />Emi Nakamura wants to change all that. She's a superstar economist who is a pioneer in the field of \"empirical macroeconomics.\" She finds clever ways of using data to untangle some of the oldest mysteries in macroeconomics, about the invisible hand, the consequences of government spending, and the inner workings of inflation.<br /><br />Recently we called her up to ask her why the economy is so difficult to understand in first place, and how she's trying to find answers anyway. She gets into all of that, and how Jeff Goldblum shaped her career as an economist, in this episode. <br /><br /><em>This show was hosted by Jeff Guo and Nick Fountain.

This theory played out at an enormous scale, in the pandemic. Consumers and companies overreacted to the risk of shortages by ordering more products and hoarding them, causing massive shifts in the supply chain \u2013 just like the theory says.<br /><br />And the pandemic gave us a lot of natural experiments like this. So, on this special live edition of Planet Money, we looked for other big economic lessons from the past three years, and we took this information and turned it into... a gameshow! It's Two Truths and a Lie: Econ Edition. We get into questions about the workforce and labor market during the pandemic, and how it affected how economists view the world.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Mary Childs.

        "description": "In 1978, a young man named Mike Shanks started a moving business in the north end of Seattle. It was just him and a truck \u2014 a pretty small operation. Things were going great. Then one afternoon, he was pulled over and cited for moving without a permit.<br /><br />The investigators who cited him were part of a special unit tasked with enforcing utilities and transportation regulations. Mike calls them the <em>furniture police</em>. To legally be a mover, Mike needed a license. Otherwise, he'd face fines \u2014 and even potentially jail time. But soon he'd learn that getting that license was nearly impossible.<br /><br />Mike is the kind of guy who just can't back down from a fight. This run-in with the law would set him on a decade-long crusade against Washington's furniture moving industry, the furniture police, and the regulations themselves. It would turn him into a notorious semi-celebrity, bring him to courtrooms across the state, lead him to change his legal name to 'Mike The Mover,' and send him into the furthest depths of Washington's industrial regulations.<br /><br />The fight was personal. But it drew Mike into a much larger battle, too: An economic battle about regulation, and who it's supposed to protect. <br /><br /><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

        "description": "Twins are used to fielding all sorts of questions, like \"Can you read each other's minds?\" or \"Can you feel each other's pain?\" Two of our Planet Money reporters are twins, and they have heard them all.<br /><br />But it's not just strangers on the street who are fascinated by twins. Scientists have been studying twins since the 1800s, trying to get at one of humanity's biggest questions: How much of what we do and how we are is encoded in our genes? The answer to this has all kinds of implications, for everything from healthcare to education, criminal justice and government spending.<br /><br />Today on the show, we look at the history of twin studies. We ask what decades of studying twins has taught us. We look back at a twin study that asked whether genes influence antisocial behavior and rule-breaking. One of our reporters was a subject in it. And we find out: are twin studies still important for science?<br /><br /><em>(Note: This episode originally ran in </em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wshkNIJGHBQM7XSyDQ2-AbG1DP_6P_-uLFjPjHkuJc/edit\"><em>2019</em></a><em>.)<br /></em><br /><em>Our show today was hosted by Sally Helm and Karen Duffin.

They both lost their jobs in the layoffs each company announced earlier this year.<br /><br />When Aashka and Nilanjan got the news, a clock started ticking. Because they are both H-1B recipients, they only have 60 days to find new jobs before they risk being sent home. And they can't get just any job \u2013 they need new employers in their field willing to sponsor their visa.<br /><br />On today's show, we followed two tech workers as they tried to find jobs before their visas expired, and what they went through as H-1B recipients trying to stay in the country.<br /><br /><em>This episode was hosted by Alyssa Jeong Perry and Amanda Aronczyk, produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler, engineered by James Willetts, fact-checked by Sierra Juarez, and edited by Molly Messick and Jess Jiang.<br /><br />Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

First, a new paper suggests that breakthrough innovations are more likely at smaller, younger companies. We talk to an inventor who left a big pharmaceutical company to start afresh, leading to some incredible treatments for serious diseases.<br /><br />Then, it's off to Mars \u2014 or at least, on the way. Elon Musk's company SpaceX did a first test launch of a rocket meant to go all the way to the red planet. The rocket made it up off of the launch pad and lumbered briefly through the sky before self-destructing over the Gulf of Mexico. Suffice it to say, it's not quite ready. NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel walks us through SpaceX's business plan as we try to figure out if this company has the funding and business acumen to reach its moonshot goal.<br /><br /><em>These two Indicator episodes were originally produced by Corey Bridges & Brittany Cronin, engineered by Katherine Silva & James Willets, and fact-checked by Dylan Sloan & Sierra Juarez.

        "description": "In the early 90s, when a young economist named Michael Kremer finished his PhD, there had been a few economic studies based on randomized trials. But they were rare. In part because randomized trials \u2013 in which you recruit two statistically identical groups, choose one of them to get a treatment, and then compare what happens to each group \u2013 are expensive, and they take a lot of time.<br /><br />But then, by chance, Michael had the opportunity to run a randomized trial in Busia, Kenya. He helped a nonprofit test whether the aid they were giving to local schools helped the students. That study paved the way for more randomized trials, and for other economists to use the method. <br /><br />On today's show, how Busia, Kenya, became <em>the</em> place where economists pioneered a more scientific way to study huge problems, from contaminated water to low graduation rates, to HIV transmission.

Prices for goods and services were high. Workers expected prices to be even higher next year, so they asked for pay raises to keep up. But then companies had to raise their prices more. And then workers asked for raises again. This the so-called wage-price spiral.<br /><br />So when prices started getting high again in 2021, economists and the U.S. Federal Reserve again worried that wage increases would become a big problem. But, it seems like the wage-price spiral hasn't happened. In fact wages, on average, have not kept up with inflation.<br /><br />There are now concerns about a totally different kind of spiral: a <em>profit</em>-price spiral.

But they made it happen, beginning on one day in 1883, and it stuck. It's a story about how railroads created, in all kinds of ways, the world we live in today.<em><br /><br />This episode was originally produced by Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi and edited by Jacob Goldstein.

        "description": "Back in 2005, Burt Banks inherited a plot of old family land in Delaware. But when it came time to sell it, he ran into a problem: his neighbor had a goat pen, and about half of it crossed over onto his property. <br /><br />Burt asked the goats' owner to move the pen, but when neighborly persuasion failed to get the job done, he changed his strategy. He sued her. And that is when things got complicated.<br /><br />Protecting private property is one of the fundamental jobs of the American legal system. If you hold a deed saying you own a plot of land, it's your land. End of story. Right?<br /><br />But, as Burt would soon learn, the law can get really complicated when it comes to determining who <em>actually</em> owns something. And when goats are involved ... anything can happen.<br /><br /><em>This episode was produced by Willa Rubin and Dylan Sloan and edited by Molly Messick. It was fact-checked by Sierra Juarez.

One likely reason for this is that the IRS disproportionately audits lower-income earners who claim a tax benefit called the earned income tax credit. And this, says law professor Dorothy Brown, is just one example of the many ways that race is woven through our tax system, its history, and its enforcement.<br /><br />Dorothy discovered the hidden relationship between race and the tax system sort of by accident, when she was helping her parents with their tax return. The amount they paid seemed too high. Eventually, her curiosity about that observation spawned a whole area of study.<br /><br />This episode is a collaboration with NPR's Code Switch podcast. Host Gene Demby spoke to Dorothy Brown about how race and taxes play out in marriage, housing, and student debt.<br /><br /><em>This episode was produced by James Sneed, with help from Olivia Chilkoti.

        "description": "Right now, the economy is running hot. Inflation is high, and central banks are pushing up interest rates to fight it. But before the pandemic, economies around the world were stuck in a different rut: low inflation, low interest rates, low growth. <br /><br />In 2013, <a href=\"https://larrysummers.com/\">Larry Summers</a> unearthed an old term from the Great Depression to explain why the economy was in this rut: secular stagnation. The theory resonated with <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/experts/senior-research-staff/olivier-blanchard?gclid=CjwKCAjw8-OhBhB5EiwADyoY1VsWki-DUWa3hP2HET7U6ipsdCrW5SlMmWjIBLmedVTMY8Gi53j5rhoCRIYQAvD_BwE\">Olivier Blanchard</a>, another leading scholar, because he had made similar observations himself. Larry and Olivier would go on to build a case for why secular stagnation was a defining theory of the economy and why government policies needed to respond to it. They helped reshape many people's understanding of the economy, and suggested that this period of slow growth and low interest rates was here to stay for a long time.<br /><br />But today, Larry and Olivier are no longer the duo they used to be. As inflation has spiked worldwide, interest rates have followed suit. Earlier this year, Larry announced that he was no longer on the secular stagnation train. Olivier, meanwhile, believes we're just going through a minor blip and will return to a period of low interest rates within the near future. He doesn't see the deep forces that led to a long-run decline in interest rates as just vanishing. Who's right? The future of the global economy could depend on the answer.<em><br /><br />Help support Planet Money  by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

That's when Planet Money reporter Chana Joffe-Walt went inside one of those banks: the Bank of Clark County, in Washington State. Her reporting on the inner workings of a bank collapse and government takeover helps explain exactly what happens when a bank goes under, minute-by-minute. <br /><br />This story originally aired in March 2009 on This American Life, from WBEZ Chicago. We're airing it for the first time in full on our podcast.<br /><br /><em>This version of the story was produced by Dylan Sloan and edited by Dave Blanchard.

        "description": "Richard J. Lonsinger is a member of the Ponca tribe of Oklahoma, who was adopted at a young age into a white family of three. He eventually reconnected with his birth family, but when his birth mother passed away in 2010, he wasn't included in the distribution of her estate. Feeling both hurt and excluded, he asked a judge to re-open her estate, to give him a part of one particular asset: an Osage headright.<br /><br />An Osage headright is a share of profits from resources like oil, gas, and coal that have been extracted from the Osage Nation's land. These payments can be sizeable - thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars a year. Historically, they were even larger \u2013 in the 1920s the Osage were some of the wealthiest people in the world. But that wealth also made them a target and subject to paternalistic and predatory laws. Over the previous century, hundreds of millions of dollars in oil money have been taken from the Osage people.<br /><br />On today's show: the story of how Richard Lonsinger gradually came to learn this history, and how he made his peace with his part of a complicated inheritance. <br /><br /><em>This episode was produced by Willa Rubin with help from Alyssa Jeong Perry and Emma Peaslee.

        "description": "Sometimes you hear these stories about an airplane that suddenly nosedives. Everyone onboard thinks this is it, and then the plane levels out and everything is fine. For about 72 hours, people and companies that had deposited millions of dollars at the Silicon Valley Bank \u2014 many of whom were in the tech industry \u2014 thought they had lost absolutely everything to a bank collapse.<br /><br />Two weeks later, the situation at Silicon Valley Bank has leveled off. The FDIC seized the bank and eventually made all of its depositors whole. But to understand what that financial panic felt like, we retrace the Silicon Valley Bank run and eventual collapse. We hear from four people who were part of the bank run \u2014 when they realized early rumblings, what it felt like in the full stampede, what hard decisions they faced, and what the aftermath felt like. And along the way, we uncover the lessons you can only learn when you think the entire world is ending. <br /><br /><em>This episode was reported by Kenny Malone, produced by Alyssa Jeong Perry with help from Dave Blanchard, engineered by Brian Jarboe, fact-checked by Sierra Juarez, and edited by Jess Jiang. <br /><br />Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

Then, in the span of just a few days, it collapsed. Whispers that SVB might be in trouble spread like wildfire through group texts and Twitter posts. Depositors raced to empty their accounts, withdrawing $42 billion in a single day. Last Friday, after regulators declared that SVB had failed, the FDIC seized the bank.<br /><br />As the dust settles on the biggest bank failure \u2014 and bank rescue \u2014 in recent memory, we're still figuring out <em>what happened. </em>But poor investment choices, weak regulation, and customer panic all played their parts.

These four New Yorkers were overly analytical, calculating, and above all, selfish.<br /><br />In other words, they had all the makings of a fascinating case study in economics.<br /><br />Economics professors Linda Ghent and Alan Grant went so far as to write an entire book on the subject, <em>Seinfeld & Economics</em>. The book points readers to economic principles that appear throughout the show, ideas like economic utility, game theory, and the best way to allocate resources in the face of scarcity.<br /><br />On today's show, we make the case that Seinfeld is, at its heart, not a show about nothing, but a show about economics.

The agency plays a critical role in the legislative process: bills can live and die by the cost estimates the CBO produces.<br /><br />The economists and budget experts at the CBO, though, are far more than just a bunch of number crunchers.

At the time, some of the drugs the CBO was trying to price didn't even exist yet.

A big part of his job was to find great scripts. The only thing \u2014 most of the 50,000-some scripts registered with the Writers Guild of America every year aren't that great. Franklin was drowning in bad scripts ...

        "description": "Every year, the U.S. government spends more money than it takes in. In order to fund all that spending, the country takes on debt. Congress has the power to limit how much debt the U.S. takes on. Right now, the debt limit is $31.4 trillion dollars. Once we reach that limit, Congress has a few options so that the government keeps paying its bills: Raise the debt limit, suspend it, or eliminate it entirely. <br />That debate and negotiations are back this season. One thing that is in short supply, but very important for these negotiations, is good information. Shai Akabas, of the Bipartisan Policy Center, knows this well. Right now, he and his team are working on figuring out when exactly the U.S. government could run out of money to pay its obligations \u2014 what they've dubbed: the \"X Date.\" <br />Shai is determined to help prevent the U.S. government from blowing past the X Date without a solution. But this year's debt-ceiling negotiations are not going very well. Which is daunting, because if lawmakers don't figure something out, the ramifications for the global economy could be huge. <br />So, how did Shai become the go-to expert at the go-to think tank for debt ceiling information? It started in 2011, back when he and current Chair of the Federal Reserve Jay Powell, armed with a powerpoint and the pressure of a deadline, helped stave off economic disaster. <br /><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org/planetmoney.</em><br /><br />Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",

        "description": "A lot of the time, economic policy can seem pretty impersonal \u2014 cold, hard, data-driven. But at the heart of the Federal Reserve are people: fallible, complicated people who are just doing their best to steer the economy in the right direction. <br /><br />Often, we remember them just for their economic decisions. But today, we're airing two episodes from our daily economics show <em>The Indicator </em>that profile the people inside the Fed. First, we're heading back to the 1970s to revisit Arthur Burns' oft-criticized stint as Fed chair. Next, we have a conversation with Mary Daly, the current president of the San Francisco Fed, about her remarkable path from high school dropout to one of the most important economic voices in the nation.<br /><br /><em>These two Indicator episodes were originally produced by Viet Le and Brittany Cronin.

And then Ben & Jerry's specializes in chunky flavors: Cherry Garcia, The Tonight Dough, Chunky Monkey, etc. The two hardly ever cross into the other's turf. Why?<br /><br />It's possible they are experiencing something common to natural competition\u2014they are specializing in what works best for them. But, as Christopher Sullivan of the University of Wisconsin-Madison suspects, the two companies may be engaging in what is known as \"tacit collusion,\" where two parties silently agree to... stick to their own territory.<br /><br />We try to get to the creamy core of what makes up a conspiracy, and how the consumer eventually loses out in this cold, cold war.<br /><br /><em>Today's episode was produced by Willa Rubin and Alyssa Jeong Perry.

Even once you find a place you like, many day cares have waitlists stretching 6 months, 9 months, a year.<br /><br />Waitlists are a classic economic sign that something isn't right, that prices are too low. But ask any parent and they will tell you that prices for day cares are actually too <em>high</em>. According to a recent report from the U.S. Treasury, more than 60% of families can't afford the full cost of high quality day care. Meanwhile, day care owners can barely afford to stay open. No one is happy.<br /><br />On today's show, we get into the very weird, very broken market for day care. We will try to understand how this market can simultaneously strain parents' budgets and underpay its workers.

On today's show, Jeff tries to win over Planet Money's resident Scrooge, Kenny Malone, by going on a quest to find him the perfect gift. Along the way, they're visited by the spirits of three Nobel prize-winning economic theories that can explain why gift-giving is actually good.
